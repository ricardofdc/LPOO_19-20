# BRICKBREAKER
The player is in control of a sliding platform that can bounce the ball into the bricks above. The player must use angles and rebounds to control the direction the balls move. If the balls fall into the abyss below, youâ€™ll lose a life. Once a player manages to destroy all the bricks, he passes the level and the difficulty increases.

## Functionalities

| MUST HAVE   | SHOULD HAVE   |
|---|---|
|  - Bricks  |  - Levels  |
|  - Bouncing ball |  - Special bricks*  |
|  - Movable paddle |  - Initial menu |
|  - Arena |  - Score count |
|  - Walls |


 ### WISH LIST 
  creating an enemy who drops bombs  
  if the bomb hits the paddle -> *gameover*  
  if the player manage to hit the enemy *3 times* with the bouncing ball -> *enemy dies*  


*(increases/decreases paddle's dimensions; increases/decreases velocity)
