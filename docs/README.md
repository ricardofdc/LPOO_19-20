# LPOO - 2020 - G32 - BRICKBREAKER

The player is in control of a sliding platform that can bounce the ball into the bricks above. The player must use angles and rebounds to control the direction the balls move. If the balls fall into the abyss below, you’ll lose a life. Once a player manages to destroy all the bricks, he passes the level and the difficulty increases.  
This project was developed by Ricardo Cardoso (up201604686@fe.up.pt) and Marta Lobo (up201604530@fe.up.pt) for LPOO 2019⁄20.


## Implemented Features
- [x] **Arena** - with insurmountable barrier
- [x] **Platform** - the player must be able to move the platform side to side when arrow left or arrow right are pressed.

## Planned Features
- [ ] **Bouncing ball** - must collide with brick and barriers
- [ ] **Normal bricks** - must disappear once they are hit by the ball
- [ ] **Special bricks** - must take more hits till they disappear / increase platform size / decrease platform size
- [ ] **Collision detection** 
- [ ] **Enemies** - must throw bombs; must disappear once it is hit 3 times by the bouncing ball
- [ ] **Score** - must increase differently depending on the type of bricks that are hit 
- [ ] **Lifes** - how many lifes the player has, must decrease whenever the player can't catch the ball
- [ ] **Levels** - 1st level must start with normals bricks only; difficulty increases throughout the levels -> more special bricks, less normal bricks, more enemies
